Quiz: Calculating NB Accuracy

In this example, we print the accuracy. However, the quiz is slightly different in that you return the accuracy, rather than printing it directly.

Remember, accuracy is defined as the number of test points that are classified correctly divided by the total number of test points.

There's another way you can do this, too--
print clf.score(features_test, labels_test)
