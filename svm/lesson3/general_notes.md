# CODING UP SVM
* Naive Bayes classification accuracy was 88.4%
* SVM is giving 92%

# NONLINEAR SVM
* SVM can do really complicated shapes by nonlinear SVM

# QUIZ: PRACTICE MAKING A NEW FEATURE
* |x| will work to separate all the points into two separate sets

# KERNEL TRICK
* There are functions that take a low dimensional feature space and map them to a high dimensional space

X<sub>1</sub>Y ---> X<sub>1</sub>1X<sub>2</sub>X<sub>3</sub>X<sub>4</sub>X<sub>5</sub>

1. a not separable feature space is mapped to higher dimension.
2. a separation solution is found in the higher feature space
3. then the separation solution is mapped back to lower feature space the separation solution found
4. The separation boundary in the lower feature space is non-linear

# QUIZ: KERNEL AND GAMMA

SVM parameters:
	1. kernel
	2. C
	3. gamma
